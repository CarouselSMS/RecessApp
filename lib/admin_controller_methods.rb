#    # you'll want to use the commented-out code in this method to
#    # display the browser popup to collect the username and password.

#    # the web server, by checking to make sure the REMOTE_USER
#    # header has been set.  If you don't want to mess with the web
#    # server configuration for doing authentication, you can see the
#    # commented-out code for an example of how to do the
#    # authentication here.
